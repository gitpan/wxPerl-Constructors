=head1 NAME

WxPerl::Constructors::argmap - auto-generated argument-map data

=head1 USAGE

  use Wx ();
  use WxPerl::Constructors::argmap;
  my $argpos = WxPerl::Constructors::argmap->ARGPOS;
  my $defaults = WxPerl::Constructors::argmap->DEFAULTS; 

Take care not to break the innards of the references.

=head1 Data

Both hashrefs are keyed by the $foo part of the Wx::$foo classnames
(i.e. without the leading "Wx::" part.)

=head2 ARGPOS

Each value is an array reference with the ordered arguments, starting
with 'id'.

=head2 DEFAULTS

Each value is a hash reference of the argument defaults.

NOTE:  No default for 'name' is included (as it needs values which are
not bound and doesn't matter because it is always last.)
