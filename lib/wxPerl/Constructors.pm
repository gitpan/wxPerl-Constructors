=head1 NAME

wxPerl::Constructors - parameterized constructors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package provides a mix of named and positional parameters which
mirrors the original C++ API, allowing you to omit default values, even
if you need to specify arguments which would otherwise follow them.

By applying C<s/Wx::([^-]*-)/wxPerl::$1-/g> (and some editing) to your
code:

  use wxPerl::Constructors;

  my $ctrl = wxPerl::TextCtrl->new($self, $label,
    style => wxTE_MULTILINE|wxTE_READONLY|wxTE_DONTWRAP);

=head1 Usage

Note the mixed positional/named arguments.  Required values are
positional and must come before key-value pairs.

  my $ctrl = wxPerl::Foo->new($parent, $req_arg, key => $value);

The exception is when there are no arguments.  This goes directly to the
Wx::Foo->new() call with no intermediate processing.

  my $ctrl = wxPerl::Foo->new();

All constructors also accept a C<($parent, \%params)> syntax, which may
be useful if you are building a data-driven class generator (or just
prefer to use named parameters for everything.)

  my $ctrl = wxPerl::Foo->new($parent,
    {
      req_arg => $req_arg,
      key     => $value,
    }
  );

In this mode, you must still provide the required arguments because
there are no default values for them (they're, uh... required.)

=head1 Advanced usage

The constructors are also (well actually, not yet) available via this
longhand form (intended as infrastructure for other packages.)

  my $ctrl = wxPerl::Constructors->new(
    'TextCtrl', $self, $label,
    style => wxTE_MULTILINE|wxTE_READONLY|wxTE_DONTWRAP);

You may inherit from wxPerl::$foo as follows:

  use wxPerl::Constructors;
  use base 'wxPerl::Frame';

CAVEAT:  There will probably be no way to deduce that you've
accidentally called a wxPerl::foo->new() with the Wx::foo-style
positional arguments.  Though it might be possible later, for now you
have to take care to change the calls.

=head1 Methods

See L<wxPerl::Constructors::doc> for available classes and details on
the argument syntax.

=begin Notes

Some issue to do with custom classes which derive from our constructors.
They should C<use base 'Wx::Thing'>, but need to have a new() which
comes from here?  This implies that we need to discover their underlying
Wx::Perl type.  I suppose we could either traverse their @ISA until we
find a m/Wx::/, and/or we could require/allow them to define a WxType
method?

Bah.  The classes are all setup to inherit from the Wx::Thingy.  That
still leaves the "I don't want to be a wxPerl::Frame" issue, but maybe
that's not really desired?

  use wxPerl::Constructors qw(override);
  use base qw(wxPerl::Frame Wx::Frame);

I'm going to let some of that slide until I see how I want to use it.
