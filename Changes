v0.0.4 2007-04-22

  * 'Build' ne 'build', but the toy computers of the world don't seem to
    comprehend that whole "A is not a" thing, so I get to build a new

    using the select portion of the English language which more
    correctly expresses my opinions of proprietary operating systems
    designed by incompetent luddites.
